 Analysis of raw data output from IonTorrent
=============================================

We assume that you have ordered primers and perfomed PCR reactions of the found genes on your voucher specimens. 
We also assume that you have followed any wet-lab protocol for library preparation for IonTorrent sequencing. 
In the paper describing PyPhyloGenomics (doi:XXXXXXXXXX), we have used a modified version of 
[Meyer and Kircher (2010)]_.
