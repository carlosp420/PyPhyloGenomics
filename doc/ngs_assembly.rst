=====================================
 Assembly of expected gene sequences 
=====================================

We will perform *de novo* assembly of the FASTQ bins that have been divided
by gene and by index (or barcode).

Each bin will be processed for quality control algorithms using the ``fastx-toolkit`` and
*de novo* assembly using ``velvet``.
